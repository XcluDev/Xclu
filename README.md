# Xclu
Xclu is a free IDE for media artists. It's modular and scriptable.

Xclu is made to help media artists (and scientists and creative coders) to do the following:
* Video, sound and 3D real time generation
* Working with ML and Computer Vision algorithms
* Controlling electronics using Arduino

## Supported platforms
Windows, Mac OS, Linux.

(TODO: Edge Computing Ready: NVidia Jetson Nano support.)

Xclu is written using Qt C++.
